# Perfect Numbers Finder

## Overview
This program identifies and displays perfect numbers within a specified range. A perfect number is an integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself.

## Program Structure
The program starts by finding and displaying perfect numbers between 1 and 200. It then prompts the user to enter an upper limit and finds perfect numbers within that range.

## Methods

### `main(String[] args)`
- Initializes the program, displays perfect numbers between 1 and 200, and handles user input for custom range.

### `displayPerfectNumbers(long upperLimit)`
- Finds and prints perfect numbers up to the specified `upperLimit`.

### `isPerfect(long number)`
- Checks whether a given number is perfect by calculating the sum of its proper divisors.
